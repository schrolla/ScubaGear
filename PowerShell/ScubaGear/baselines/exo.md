# Decisions:

## Baseline vs Policy Number in Policy ID:
### Keeping Baseline Number
- Will need to update all policies regardless change if a policy in the baseline has updated (in the markdown and all other hardcoded instances (e.g. functional tests, .md files, rego))
  - CON May cause a false sense of a policy change for users
- PRO Allows exact identification of a policy to a baseline for troubleshooting efforts 
- PRO David has noted he has started working on a automated way to increment baseline md files (for GWS)


### Changing to Policy Number
Changing baseline number to policy number in the current policy ID scheme 
- PRO allows the user to identify if a policy has been updated
- CON If a user identifies a policy ID that is not the currently version of the policy the team will need to parse through baseline versions to identify the correct version
  - EXAMPLE: Current EXO Baseline v3.1.0 & Policy MS.EXO.1.1v8
  - User requests information for MS.EXO.1.1v6; The M365 team would need to review multiple baselines versions to identify the correct policy 

## Major & Minor increment changes for versions:
### Baseline:
Only Major increments: EXO.md v1.0 -> EXO.md v2.0  
- PRO David has noted he has started working on a automated way to increment baseline md files (for GWS).
- CON may cause a false sense in update for the user without reading the details in the changelog

Mixed Major and Minor increases: EXO.md v1.0 -> EXO.md v1.1 -> EXO.md v2.0  
- PRO David has noted he has started working on a automated way to increment baseline md files (for GWS). David noted that this can be adjusted for minor increases.
- PRO allows the team to better define major and minor updates
- CON If we are keeping baseline version in the policy ID, an enhancement would need to be made to support minor increases in policy IDs

### Policy (only used if the policy ID has been updated to reflect policy version):
Only Major increments: MS.EXO.1.1v1 -> MS.EXO.1.1v2
- PRO supports the current policy automation 

Mixed Major and Minor increases: MS.EXO.1.1v1 -> MS.EXO.1.1v1.1 -> MS.EXO.1.1v2
- PRO allows the team to better define major and minor updates to a policy
- CON need to define major and minor udaptes to a policy
- CON Major updates to a policy can be seen as a "new" policy which can warrent a new policy ID

## Baseline version consistency
### Do we want to keep all baseline versions with each release?
YES (major increases only)
- aad.md v2.0
- defender.md v2.0
- exo.md v2.0

  - PRO - uniformity across baselines
  - PRO - David has noted he has started working on a automated way to increment baseline md files (for GWS).
  - CON - can cause a false sense of update for the user
  - CON - If a baseline does it update this will trigger all baselines and policy ID (if baseline version is used) to be updated 


NO (major increases only)
- aad.md v2.0
- defender.md v1.0
- exo.md v1.0

  - PRO - Better alignment with updates to policies and updates for the reader to follow
  - PRO - David has noted he has started working on a automated way to increment baseline md files (for GWS).


YES (mixed major and minor increases)
- aad.md v1.1
- defender.md v1.1
- exo.md v1.1

  - PRO - uniformity across baselines
  - PRO - David has noted he has started working on a automated way to increment baseline md files (for GWS).
  - CON - can cause a false sense of update for the user
  - CON - If a baseline does it update this will trigger all baselines and policy ID (if baseline version is used) to be updated 
  - CON - If we are keeping baseline version in the policy ID, an enhancement would need to be made to support minor increases in policy IDs


NO (mixed major and minor increases)
- aad.md v2.1
- defender.md v1.0
- exo.md v1.4

  - PRO - Better alignment with updates to policies and updates for the reader to follow
  - PRO - David has noted he has started working on a automated way to increment baseline md files (for GWS).
  - CON - If we are keeping baseline version in the policy ID, an enhancement would need to be made to support minor increases in policy IDs

## Deleted Policy Format:
### potentially adding in a separate md file for deleted policies
  - PRO removes clutter of removed policies from markdown file
  - CON may cause numbering gaps without full context
  - Hybrid approach can list deleted policies and link to deleted markdown
  - CON ENHANCEMENT additional automation needs to be created to support functionality of this new markdown file

### changing v_ to X. Example: MS.EXO.2.1v1 -> MS.EXO.2.1X
  - PRO currently the code reads the X and parses this policy out of the report (CON currently a bug)
  - PRO there currently is 
  - CON can cause confusion to the user due to change in format

### using strikethrough formatting
  - PRO easy identifier for the user to see policies that have been deleted
  - CON enhancement is needed to update automation to support strikethrough

### adding in a new policy note section below rationale and note
 Format: MS.M365PRODUCT.GROUP#.POLICY#v# was removed in M365PRODUCT.md v[] because [rationale for removal]
 EXAMPLE: 
 - _Policy Note:_ Policy MS.EXO.2.1v1 was removed in exo.md version 1.1.0 because it is not a security configuation that can be audited and has been added to MS.EXO.2.2v2.
  
  - PRO does not clash with existing note section
  - PRO provides the version of the baseline the policy was removed and rationale

### deleting the policy and implmentation and only noting the removal in the changelog
- PRO Do not have to worry about formatting and scalability
- CON may cause confusion for users who do not read the changelog

## Examples

### Baseline Update Example 1:
- updated version number in deleted policy to "X"
- strikethrough policy ID, policy, and rationale
- updated last modified to March 2024
- added note to deleted policy noting the removal and rationale for removal
- noted that the policy was removed in reference to the next baseline version (used minor increase for baseline v1.0.0 -> v1.1.0 
- updated policy id scheme to use policy id instead of baseline version (seen in new policy MS.EXO.2.2v2. This is also a "major" increase in version)
- updated MS.EXO.2.2v1 to MS.EXO.2.2v2
- updated MS.EXO.2.2v2 policy language
- updated MS.EXO.2.2v2 last modified date
- in implementation section updated version number in deleted policy to "X"
- used strikethrough for implementation section



### Policies

~~#### MS.EXO.2.1X
A list of approved IP addresses for sending mail SHALL be maintained.~~

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.2.1v1; Criticality: SHALL -->
~~- _Rationale:_ Failing to maintain an accurate list of authorized IP addresses may result in spoofed email messages or failure to deliver legitimate messages when SPF is enabled. Maintaining such a list helps ensure that unauthorized servers sending spoofed messages can be detected, and permits message delivery from legitimate senders.~~
- _Last modified:_ March 2024
- _Policy Note:_ Policy MS.EXO.2.1v1 was removed in exo.md version 1.1.0 because it is not a security configuation that can be audited and has been added to MS.EXO.2.2v2.


#### MS.EXO.2.2v2
An SPF policy SHALL be published for each domain that fails all non-approved senders.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.2.2v2; Criticality: SHALL -->
- _Rationale:_ An adversary may modify the `FROM` field
of an email such that it appears to be a legitimate email sent by an
agency, facilitating phishing attacks. Publishing an SPF policy for each agency domain mitigates forged `FROM` fields by providing a means for recipients to detect emails spoofed in this way.  SPF is required for FCEB departments and agencies by Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 18-01, "Enhance Email and Web Security".

### Implementation

~~#### MS.EXO.2.1X Instructions
Identify any approved senders specific to your agency.
Additionally, see [External DNS records required for SPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/external-domain-name-system-records?view=o365-worldwide#external-dns-records-required-for-spf) for
inclusions required for Microsoft to send email on behalf of your domain.~~

#### MS.EXO.2.2v2 Instructions
SPF is not configured through the Exchange admin center, but rather via
DNS records hosted by the agency's domain. Thus, the exact steps needed
to set up SPF varies from agency to agency. See [Add or edit an SPF TXT record to help prevent email spam (Outlook, Exchange Online) \| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider?view=o365-worldwide#add-or-edit-an-spf-txt-record-to-help-prevent-email-spam-outlook-exchange-online) for more details.

To test your SPF configuration, consider using a web-based tool, such as
those listed under [How can I validate SPF records for my domain? \| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/domains-faq?view=o365-worldwide#how-can-i-validate-spf-records-for-my-domain).
Additionally, SPF records can be requested using the
PowerShell tool `Resolve-DnsName`. For example:

```
Resolve-DnsName example.onmicrosoft.com txt
```

If SPF is configured, you will see a response resembling `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all`
returned; though by necessity, the contents of the SPF
policy may vary by agency. In this example, the SPF policy indicates
the IP addresses listed by the policy for "spf.protection.outlook.com" are
the only approved senders for "example.onmicrosoft.com." These IPs can be determined
via an additional SPF lookup, this time for "spf.protection.outlook.com." Ensure
the IP addresses listed as approved senders for your domain are those identified for
MS.EXO.2.1v1. See [SPF TXT record syntax for Microsoft 365 \| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/email-authentication-anti-spoofing?view=o365-worldwide#spf-txt-record-syntax-for-microsoft-365) for a more in-depth discussion
of SPF record syntax.

## 3. DomainKeys Identified Mail

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows digital signatures to be added
to email messages in the message header, providing a layer of both
authenticity and integrity to emails. As with SPF, DKIM relies on DNS
records; thus, its deployment depends on how an agency manages its DNS.
Exchange Online Protection (EOP) features include DKIM signing capabilities.

### Policies

#### MS.EXO.3.1v1
DKIM SHOULD be enabled for all domains.

<!--Policy: MS.EXO.3.1v1; Criticality: SHOULD -->
- _Rationale:_ An adversary may modify the `FROM` field
of an email such that it appears to be a legitimate email sent by an
agency, facilitating phishing attacks. Enabling DKIM is another means for
recipients to detect spoofed emails and verify the integrity of email content.
